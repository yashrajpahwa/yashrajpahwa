### Hello World!

- I am a technologist with a strong inclination for product and strategy.
- In my free time, I enjoy spending time with people who are much more knowledgeable than I am.

targeted mini-projects:

- [basics-of-go](https://github.com/wolffkishner/basics-of-go) - learning Go in public
- [text-to-speech](https://github.com/wolffkishner/text-to-speech) - demonstration of the web speech API
- [netflix-homepage-react](https://github.com/wolffkishner/netflix-homepage-react) - a copy of the excellent Netflix homepage in reactjs

some design experiments:

- website design for my school hosting an interschool competition (was done in a few hours) - [Link](https://www.figma.com/design/IrBrArJ0Bl5NcN7yyQfxeH/eniac-secondary-design?node-id=0-1&t=Ozpa2bLvd307eqPa-1)
